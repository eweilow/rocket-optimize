\section{Project summary}
This project formulates an approximate model of the conditions encountered for an orbital class launch vehicle during ascent into Low-Earth orbit,
as well as a strategy for trajectory optimization for polar and equatorial launches.

The project is split into four major parts: the equations describing the rocket, the physics model, the ascent guidance algorithm as well as the optimization of parameters.

\section{Intrinsic equations describing the rocket}
\subsection{Input parameters}
The state of the rocket can be described with position, velocity and expended mass ($m_e$)
$$
S = (\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m) = (x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z, m_e)
$$
where $m_e$ is the integral of exhaust mass flow (propulsion) over time
$$
m_e(t) = \int_0^t \dot{m}(S,t) dt
$$

The reason for including expended mass in the model is that it lets us derive the currently active stage, 
as well as the necessary variables of the rocket as a function of used propellant. This is done by considering each state as collection of parameters
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ r  | l  }
  Parameter & Description \\
  \hline
  $m_{prop,i}$ & Propellant mass of stage \\
  $m_{dry,i}$ & Dry mass of stage (without propellant) \\
  $F_{sl,i}$ & Thrust at sea level pressure \\
  $F_{vac,i}$ & Thrust in vacuum pressure \\
  $I_{sp,sl,i}$ & Specific impulse at sea level \\
  $I_{sp,vac,i}$ & Specific impulse in vacuum pressure
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

such that each stage $i=0,1,2...$ can be written
$$
s_i = (m_{prop,i}, m_{dry,i}, F_{sl,i}, F_{vac,i}, I_{sp,sl,i}, I_{sp,vac,i})
$$

Furthermore, a rocket typically has an aerodynamic shell (fairing) that is deployed around the edge of space (100km). This is modelled simply by the parameters
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ r  | l  }
    Parameter & Description \\
    \hline
    $m_i$ & Mass of fairing \\
    $h_{deployment,i}$ & Altitude of deployment
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
such that each fairing $i=0,1,2...$ can be written
$$
f_i = (m_i, h_{deployment,i})
$$

Lastly, the payload of the rocket is modelled as a mass $m_{payload}$.

\subsection{Derived parameters}
To run simulations of defined by the parameters in the previous section, 
we need to derive the current mass of the entire rocket. This is not as simple as subtracting $m_e$ from the initial mass, as we want to model staging.
Instead consider parameters driven by the currently active stage $s_{active}$.

\subsubsection{Mass}

If the propellant of stages before $s_i$ is
$$
m'_{prop,i} = \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} m_{prop,j}
$$
then the currently active stage fulfill the criteria
$$
m'_{prop,active} < m_e(t) < m'_{prop,active} + m_{prop,active}
$$

As we are only considering a two stage launch vehicle, the active stage can be defined by
$$
s_{active} = \begin{cases} 
  s_0 & : m_e < m_{prop,0} \\
  s_1 & : 0 < m_e - m_{prop,0} < m_{prop,1}
\end{cases}
$$

If the mass of stages after the stage $s_i$ is
$$
m'_{stages,i} = \sum_{j=i+1} m_{prop,j} + m_{dry,j}
$$
This defines the current mass of stages, when $s_{i}$ is active, as
$$
m_{stagemass,i} = \left( m_e(t) - m'_{prop,i} \right) + m_{dry,i} + m'_{stages,i}
$$

If $h_{max}$ is the maximum altitude reached up until time $t$, then the mass of fairings currently on the rocket can be described by the sum
$$
m_{fairings}(h_{max}) = \sum_{i=0} m_i (1 - H(h_{max} - h_{deployment,i}))
$$

Thus, the total instantaneous mass for an active stage $s_i$ is
$$
m_i = m_{stagemass,i} + m_{fairings}(h_{max}) + m_{payload}
$$

\subsubsection{Thrust}

Since the thrust of a rocket propulsion system is linear in the pressure difference between the exhaust and surrounding pressure, 
it is assumed in our model that the thrust $F$ changes linearly between $F_{sea}$ and $F_{vacuum}$ with pressure $p$.
%
% https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/thrsteq.html
%

For a given active stage $s_i$, if pressure is written as a function of altitude $h$, thrust can be written as 
$$
F_i(p(h)) = F_{sl,i} + \left( F_{sl,i} - F_{vac,i} \right) \frac{p(h)}{p(0)}
$$

This only holds if the stage has remaining fuel ($m_e - m_{prop,i} > 0$) 
otherwise 
$$
F_i(p(h)) = 0
$$

\subsubsection{Mass flow}
% 
% https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/specimp.html 
%
Mass flow is necessary to find $m_e(t)$, and is given in a general form by
$$
\dot{m} = \frac{F}{ g_0 I_{sp}}
$$

If we assume mass flow to be constant through the propulsion system, then $I_{sp}$ must share the same linear behaviour in pressure as thrust does.
Thus, for an active stage $s_i$, let
$$
I_{sp,i}(p(h)) = I_{sp,sl,i} + \left( I_{sp,sl,i} - I_{sp,vac,i} \right) \frac{p(h)}{p(0)}
$$

This gives the mass flow
$$
\dot{m}_i(p(h)) = \frac{F_i(p(h))}{ g_0 I_{sp,i}(p(h))}
$$

Finally, to tie the equations together, we define 
$$
m(m_e) = m_i, \quad 
F(m_e, p(h)) = F_i(p(h)), \quad 
\dot{m}(m_e, p(h)) = \dot{m}_i(p(h)) \quad 
$$
where the active stage $s_i$ is derived from a given $m_e$.

\section{Physics model}
To simulate the ascent of the rocket, a model of the physics involved is required.

\subsection{Coordinate system}
The simulation uses two coordinate systems, one cartesian and one kinematic.
The cartesian system $\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}$ is originated in the starting location and oriented such that
$\hat{x}$ points towards the wanted direction of orbit,
$\hat{y}$ points radially up, and $\hat{z} = \hat{x} \times \hat{y}$.

The kinematic system $\hat{r}, \hat{t}, \hat{z}$ follows the rocket and is oriented such that 
$\hat{r}$ is the normalized radial vector, $\hat{z}$ is the same as in the cartesian system, 
and the tangential vector is $\hat{t} = \hat{r} \times \hat{z}$. In a circular orbit, $\hat{t}$ is parallel to velocity $\vec{v}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbit.png}
  \caption{The instantaneous coordinates}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Atmosphere}
%
% Here we write a bit about the american standard atmosphere model
%
Produces $\rho(r)$

\subsection{Forces}
In this model, it assumed that three forces are acting on the rocket: thrust $T$, aerodynamic drag $D$ and gravity $G$.

\subsubsection{Gravity - G}
Gravity is modelled based on the Newtonian formulation, resulting in a force
$$
\vec{G}(\vec{r}, m_e) = -m(m_e) \frac{\mu}{r^2} \hat{r} 
$$
where r is the distance to the center of Earth from the rocket, and $\mu \approx 3.986\cdot10^{14} m^3 s^{âˆ’2}$ is the standard gravitational parameter.

\subsubsection{Aerodynamic drag - D}
% 
% Include Drag equation
% Include atmospheric model incl. reference
% Include typical C_d
%
To model aerodynamic drag it first is assumed that the atmosphere, independently of radius, moves at a velocity:
$$
\vec{v}_{atm} (\vec{r}) = v_{surf} \cdot \hat{t}
$$
This allows the definition of the wind-relative velocity
$$
\vec{v}_{atm,rel} (\vec{r}, \vec{v}) = \vec{v} - \vec{v}_{atm} (\vec{r})
$$

%
% TYPICAL VALUE REFERENCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE THANKS
%
Under the assumption that the the drag equation holds for the entirety of the ascent, then
$$
\vec{D}(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e) = - \frac{ m(m_e) \cdot  C_d  \cdot A \cdot \rho(r) }{2} {\left| \vec{v}_{atm,rel} (\vec{r}, \vec{v}) \right|}^2 \hat{v}
$$
% coefficient of drag $C_d = 0.2$, 
\subsubsection{Thrust - T}

%
% stuff about mass flow
%

To abstract the guidance algorithms from the physics model, it is assumed that guidance controls throttle as
$$
\eta = \eta(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e, t)\in[0,1]
$$
and angle of thrust (AoT) from the vertical $\hat{r}$ as
$$
\theta = \theta(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e, t)\in\left[0,\pi\right]
$$

Throttle and AoT interact such that 
$$
\vec{T}(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e, t) = \left( \cos \theta \hat{r} + \sin \theta \hat{t} \right) \cdot F(m_e, P) \cdot \eta
$$

\subsection{Differential equation}
The combination of gravity, aerodynamic drag, and thrust give the equation
$$
\vec{a}(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e) = \frac{1}{m_i} \left( G(\vec{r}, m_e) + D(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e) + T(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, m_e, t) \right)
$$

\section{Ascent guidance}
The ascent guidance implemented in the simulation can be categorized into five phases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Liftoff
  \item Kickpitch
  \item Gravity turn
  \item Orbital insertion
  \item Terminal guidance
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./plots/angleFromVertical.png}
  \caption{Typical thrust angle from vertical (intentionally without units)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Liftoff ($0 < t < t_{vertical}$)}
During this phase, the trajectory is entirely vertical - $\theta = 0$ and $\eta = 1$.

\subsection{Kickpitch ($t_{vertical} < t < t_{kickpitch}$)}
During this phase, the trajectory starts pitching towards the horizon slightly.
The angle $\theta$ is linearly interpolated between 0 and the defining parameter $\theta_{kickpitch} = 4^{\circ}$ according to
$$
\theta(t) = \theta_{kickpitch} \frac{t - t_{vertical}}{t_{kickpitch} - t_{vertical}}
$$

\subsection{Gravity turn ($\dot{m} t_{kickpitch} < m_e(t) < m_{prop,0}$)}
During the time between the end of kickpitch and the time of staging (when the expended mass is equal to the propellant in the first stage),
the angle $\theta$ is linearly interpolated between $\theta_{kickpitch}$ and the defining parameter $\theta_{staging}$ according to
$$
\theta(t) = \theta_{kickpitch} + \left( \theta_{staging} - \theta_{kickpitch} \right) \frac{m_e(t) - \dot{m} t_{kickpitch}}{m_{prop,0} - \dot{m} t_{kickpitch}}
$$

\subsection{Orbital insertion ($m_{prop,0} < m_e(t) < m_{prop,0} + m_{prop,1}$)}
This phase lasts until terminal guidance is triggered. The angle $\theta$ is interpolated from $\theta_{staging}$ to 0 according to
$$
\theta(t) = \theta_{staging} \left( 1 - \frac{m_e(t) - m_{prop,0}}{m_{prop,1}} \right)
$$

\subsection{Terminal guidance}
Terminal guidance is necessary to achieve a circular orbit within this simulation and previously mentioned ascent guidance parameters.
It consists of a PI-controller that attempts to cancel out any vertical velocity.

The conditions for entering terminal guidance is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $h > g_{ap} - 55$
  \item OR:
  \item $h > 100$ and $\left| \vec{v} \cdot \hat{r} \right| < 50$
\end{itemize}

Within terminal guidance, $\theta$ is controlled with the regulator 
$$
\theta = 5 \cdot e(t) + 5 \int_{t_{triggered}}^t e(t') dt'
$$
where $t_{triggered}$ is the time at which terminal guidance was triggered, and
$$
e(t) = \vec{v} \cdot \hat{r}
$$

Furthermore, throttle is controlled by
$$
\eta = \begin{cases}
0 & : \quad r_{pe} > g_{pe} - 2 km, \quad g_{ap} - 2 km < r_{ap} < g_{ap} + 3 km \\
0 & : \quad r_{pe} > g_{pe} - 2 km, \left| \vec{v} \cdot \hat{r} \right| < 15 km \\
0.05 & : \quad r_{pe} > g_{pe} - 10 km \\
0.25 & : \quad r_{pe} > 0 km \\
0.5 & : \quad r_{pe} > -100 km \\
1 & :  \quad otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

If $\eta = 0$, the simulation ends in orbit.

\section{Analysis}

By the results achieved, it's clear that orbital launch from the equator is better than launch from the poles. 
One must be careful just looking at the results however, as one might say that it is not by a huge margin that equatorial launch is better, but that's where the tyranny of the rocket equation comes into play.
If our payload goal is to place 10000 kg into a 220 km orbit, then reducing the fuel consumption by 3500 kg allows a much smaller first stage, as the rocket equation tends toward exponential changes.

It is however interesting that the fuel consumption is the most equal for a target orbit of 170 km. Without knowing for certain what the result should be, the way that the trajectory is created and optimized will 
play a role. The \textit{very} simple guidance algorithm is definitely just scraping the surface of what is possible.
