\section{The model}
To simulate the ascent of the rocket, a model of the physics involved is required.
In this model, it assumed that only main three forces are acting on the rocket: its thrust $T$, aerodynamic drag $D$ and gravity $G$.
All three of these forces need approximations in order to run the simulation with reasonable result.


\subsection{Coordinate system}
Let $\hat{r}$ denote the normalized radial vector.
Let furthermore $\hat{z}$ be oriented according to the right-hand rule relative to the direction of travel.
Then, the tangential vector is $\hat{t} = \hat{r} \times \hat{z}$.

\subsection{State vectors}

\subsection{Gravity - G}
Gravity is modelled based on the Newtonian formulation, resulting in a force
$$
\vec{G}(r) = -\frac{\mu}{r^2} \hat{r} 
$$
where r is the distance to the center of Earth from the rocket, and $\mu \approx 3.986\cdot10^{14} m^3 s^{âˆ’2}$ is the standard gravitational parameter for Earth.

\subsection{Aerodynamic drag - D}
To model aerodynamic drag, it is assumed that the atmosphere moves at a velocity, independent of radius
$$
\vec{v}_{atm} (\vec{r}) = v_{surf} \cdot \hat{t} (\vec{r})
$$
This allows the definiton of the wind-relative velocity
$$
\vec{v}_{atm,rel} (\vec{r}, t) = \vec{v} (t) - \vec{v}_{atm} (\vec{r})
$$
\subsection{Thrust - D}
